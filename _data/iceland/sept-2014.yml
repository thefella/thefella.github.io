faq: 
  - question: How is payment handled?
    answer: We use a third-party service called [Ti.to](https://ti.to). This not only allows us secure online transactions, but we can accept numerous forms of payment from credit card to PayPal — whatever suits you best!
  - question: What about flights?
    answer: Flights to Iceland are not included, so shop around for the best deal (as always, the earlier you book, the better). For the weekend workshop, plan to arrive on the Friday morning/early afternoon, leaving Monday morning. For the week adventure, plan to arrive on the Sunday afternoon (you'll need some accommodation - we can help with this) and leave on the following Sunday afternoon / evening or Monday morning (you'd need some accommodation for Sunday night). [Let us know](mailto:contact@f8.pe) if you have any questions whatsoever!
  - question: What type of accommodation should I expect?
    answer: For the **Weekend Workshop**, you will be staying in hotels around the shooting locations. During the **7-day Adventure** week, you will be sleeping in a van, as that allows us to stay mobile and chase the weather — giving you the best opportunity for great shots!
  - question: What if the weather is bad?
    answer: Often stormy weather actually makes more interesting skies for our photographs! During the **Weekend Workshop**, we will have a *Plan B* in the case of extremely severe (aka unsafe) weather, involving food and post-processing. For the **7-day Adventure**, we can always drive and find better weather (photographically speaking).
  - question: What skill levels do you teach?
    answer: We teach everyone from beginners to advanced photographers. Even if you don’t have a DSLR, we can help you get the best out of whatever camera you bring along ([get in touch](mailto:contact@f8.pe) if you have any gear-specific questions prior to booking).
  - question: Will I get to see the Northern Lights?
    answer: Possibly! There is no guarantee that we’ll see them, as there are many weather-related variables involved, such as solar activity and cloud cover. That said, we will try our best to find them — and if you’re on our **7-day Adventure**, the chances will be much higher!
  - question: What if I need more information?
    answer: Feel free to [contact us](mailto:contact@f8.pe) with any queries that you may have. Once you are registered, we will send out an information pack prior to the workshop with more details. You can also tweet Conor ([@thefella](https://twitter.com/thefella)), Greg ([@greg_a](https://twitter.com/greg_a)) or Dan ([@danrubin](https://twitter.com/danrubin)).
  - question: What about cancellations?
    answer: "In general, we do not offer refunds, however: Depending on when you cancel and your reasons, we will do our best to refund all or some of your registration fee. You are also more than welcome to transfer your place to someone else if you can’t make it. Please check our complete [Terms & Conditions](/assets/docs/iceland/Iceland_Expedition_2014_T&C.pdf) for more details."
