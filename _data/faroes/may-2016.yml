  - question: How is payment handled?
    answer: We use a third-party service called [Ti.to](https://ti.to). This not only allows us secure online transactions, but we can accept numerous forms of payment from credit card to PayPal — whatever suits you best!
  - question: What about flights?
    answer: Flights to the Faroe Islands are not included, so shop around for the best deal (as always, the earlier you book, the better). You can fly with [Atlantic Airways](https://www.atlantic.fo) from Edinbugh, Copenhagen, Barcelona and Reykjavik, amongst others. [Let us know](mailto:contact@f8.pe) if you have any questions whatsoever!
  - question: What type of accommodation should I expect?
    answer: "We'll be staying at [Hotel Føroyar](http://www.hotelforoyar.com), a beautiful four star hotel overlooking the Faroese capital of Tórshavn."
  - question: What if the weather is bad?
    answer: The weather in the Faroe Islands can be wet and foggy. This can actually make for some fantastically moody photography! If it gets too bad, we will have a *Plan B* in the case of extremely severe (aka unsafe) weather, involving food and post-processing.
  - question: What skill levels do you teach?
    answer: We teach everyone from beginners to advanced photographers. Even if you don’t have a DSLR, we can help you get the best out of whatever camera you bring along ([get in touch](mailto:contact@f8.pe) if you have any gear-specific questions prior to booking).
