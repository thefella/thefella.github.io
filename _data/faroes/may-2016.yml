faq:
  - question: How is payment handled?
    answer: We use a third-party service called [Billetto](https://billetto.co.uk). This not only allows us secure online transactions, but we can accept numerous forms of payment from credit card to PayPal — whatever suits you best!
  - question: What about flights?
    answer: "Flights to the Faroe Islands are not included, so shop around for the best deal (as always, the earlier you book, the better). You can fly with [Atlantic Airways](https://www.atlantic.fo) from many locations including Copenhagen, Edinburgh, Reykjavik and Bergen. Flight times vary. Let us know if you have any questions. If you feel you want to come early to get the best flights please let us know and we can help and advise."
  - question: What type of accommodation should I expect?
    answer: "We'll be staying at [Hotel Føroyar](http://www.hotelforoyar.com), a beautiful four star hotel overlooking the Faroese capital of Tórshavn."
  - question: What if the weather is bad?
    answer: The Faroe Islands sit in the middle of the Gulf Stream. While this means it never really gets too cold, the weather can be unpredictable – but this is what makes it so interesting! Wet and foggy conditions make for some fantastically moody photography! If it gets too bad, we will have a Plan B in the case of extremely severe (aka unsafe) weather, involving food and post-processing and shooting techniques. We never stop learning!
  - question: What skill levels do you teach?
    answer: We teach everyone from beginners to advanced photographers. Even if you don’t have a DSLR, we can help you get the best out of whatever camera you bring along ([get in touch](mailto:zoetimmers@me.com) if you have any gear-specific questions prior to booking).
  - question: What if I need more information?
    answer: Feel free to [contact us](mailto:zoetimmers@me.com) with any queries that you may have. Once you are registered, we will send out an information pack prior to the workshop with more details.
  - question: What about cancellations?
    answer: "Please check our complete [Terms & Conditions](/assets/docs/faroes/Faroe_Islands_May_2016_T&C.pdf) for more details."

      This is a fantastic opportunity if you're thinking about making the switch to a micro four thirds system that doesn't compromise image quality. We had a chance to test out the OM-D EM1 ourselves recently and were seriously impressed with its super fast focussing, amazing array of professional standard lenses and low light capabilities to rival full frame DSLR systems, all within a light weight body that's perfect for hiking around.

      The great news is that each participant will be entered into a prize draw where you could potentially win an OM-D EM1 system to take home with you.
