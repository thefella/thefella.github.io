#7-day Adventure add-on

September is one of the best times of year to see the Northern Lights in Iceland, and for those of you interested in a *no-frills, drive and sleep in a van, shoot all night in middle of nowhere* extension to your Weekend Workshop, we’re making an **additional trip** immediately after, setting off Monday morning and spending 6 long nights chasing the Aurora Borealis (which there’s no guarantee we’ll see) and stopping off at many of Iceland's most picturesque locations, with a relaxing day at the famous [Blue Lagoon](http://www.bluelagoon.com) on Sunday to top it all off.

It’s rough, it’s tiring, and it’s not for everyone — but if it’s for you, we’re inviting a few people to join us from **September 22–28** to experience our approach to capturing the night skies.
