Join [three experienced photographers & travellers](#teachers) as we take you on a journey through Iceland. You’ll experience everything from mountains and waterfalls to cities and statues. We’ll drive you to our favourite locations, with constant personal instruction from each one of us.

As well as learning how to shoot landscapes and the night sky with your DSLR (or film cameras / smartphone), our post-processing workshop will teach you everything you need to edit your images like a pro!


### Something for everyone
Whether you’re a complete beginner or seasoned pro, there’s something to be gained from this fantastic trip to Iceland.

Always fancied a photography trip to Iceland, but can’t find the time? Our Weekend Workshop is the perfect cure for your inner Walter Mitty!

#7-day Adventure add-on

September is one of the best times of year to see the Northern Lights in Iceland, and for those of you interested in a *no-frills, drive and sleep in a van, shoot all night in middle of nowhere* extension to your Weekend Workshop, we’re making an **additional trip** immediately after, setting off Monday morning and spending 6 long nights chasing the Aurora Borealis (which there’s no guarantee we’ll see) and stopping off at many of Iceland's most picturesque locations, with a relaxing day at the famous [Blue Lagoon](http://www.bluelagoon.com) on Sunday to top it all off.

It’s rough, it’s tiring, and it’s not for everyone — but if it’s for you, we’re inviting a few people to join us from **September 22–28** to experience our approach to capturing the night skies.
