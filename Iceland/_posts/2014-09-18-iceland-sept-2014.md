Join [three experienced photographers & travellers](#teachers) as we take you on a journey through Iceland. You’ll experience everything from mountains and waterfalls to cities and statues. We’ll drive you to our favourite locations, with constant personal instruction from each one of us.

As well as learning how to shoot landscapes and the night sky with your DSLR (or film cameras / smartphone), our post-processing workshop will teach you everything you need to edit your images like a pro!


### Something for everyone
Whether you’re a complete beginner or seasoned pro, there’s something to be gained from this fantastic trip to Iceland.

Always fancied a photography trip to Iceland, but can’t find the time? Our Weekend Workshop is the perfect cure for your inner Walter Mitty!
